# JavaProgramsSem4

A repository containing all Java programs developed during Object Oriented Programming with Java Lab Sessions at **Unitedworld School of Computational Intelligence (USCI), Karnavati University**.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repository serves as a resource for practicing and revising core Java concepts, OOP principles, and exception handling, along with some real-world problem-solving using Java. Each program is designed to help students solidify their understanding of Java programming.

## 📝 List of Programs

### 🧑‍💻 Basic Programs
1. Print "Hello World! This is my First Java Program."
2. Perform arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷) on two numbers.
3. Find the greatest of three entered numbers.
4. Find the lowest of three entered numbers.
5. Check whether a number is odd or even.
6. Convert distance from KM to Miles and vice versa.
7. Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
8. Print the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms.
9. Compare two floating-point numbers up to three decimal places.
10. Identify if the entered character is a vowel or consonant with error handling for invalid input.
11. Check if a year is a leap year.
12. Display the first 10 natural numbers.
13. Display the multiplication table for a given number.

### 🔢 Patterns
14. Print a triangle pattern with repeating numbers:
    ```
    1
    22
    333
    4444
    ```
15. Print a triangle pattern with incremented numbers:
    ```
    1
    2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9 10
    ```

### 👨‍🏫 Object-Oriented Programs
16. Add two numbers using class and object.
17. Create a `Student` class with marks for 3 subjects, calculate average.
18. Implement single inheritance using `Person` and `Employee` classes.
19. Create a class hierarchy with a base class `Shape`, and derived classes `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`. Implement `area()` and `perimeter()` methods.
20. Develop a simple online shopping system using inheritance and polymorphism.
21. Implement `BankAccount`, with subclasses `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount`, demonstrating method overriding.

### 📦 Package & Modular Java
22. Create a bookstore management system using Java packages:
    - `bookstore.book` → Class: `Book` (title, author, ISBN, price)
    - `bookstore.inventory` → Class: `InventoryManager` (add/update stock, retrieve book details)

### 🔁 Loops, Recursion & Numbers
23. Find factorial of a number.
24. Find sum of digits of a number.

### 🛑 Exception Handling
25. Handle `ArithmeticException` using try-catch.
26. Handle `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` using try-catch.
27. Use `throw` keyword to create a custom exception.
28. Use `throws` keyword to handle a custom exception.

### 🧵 Multithreading
29. Demonstrate multithreading with count from 1 to 5 with a 1-second delay.

### 📦 Wrapper Classes & Built-in Methods
30. Perform autoboxing and unboxing.
31. Use 5 methods from the `Math` class.
32. Use 5 methods from the `String` class.
33. Use 5 methods from the `StringBuffer` class.
